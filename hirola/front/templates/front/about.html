                <p>For many years, there have been many low quality tech products from abroad in the Kenyan market, and extremely high prices of new smartphones.
                  This has made it impossible for Kenyans to afford quality devices. At Tekesquared, we are changing things for the better.</p>

                <p>On Tekesquared you buy quality mint condition electronics sourced directly from the USA/Canada and delivered to your doorstep at an affordable price.
                  Mint condition phones are phones that are resold with (1) perfect screen condition (2) function flawlessly and (3) have no signs of use.</p>

                <p>To uphold our promise of providing only quality original-model phones, we handpick the phones ourselves and ensure that they are compatible
                  with the Kenyan network providers and are free from defects. As a principle, we don't sell broken/fake goods.</p>

                <p>Tekesquared was founded in 2018 by Murage and Peter, long-time friends and software and mobile developers.</p>
                <p>The inspiration for Tekesquared sparked when Murage got numerous requests from people in Kenya to ship them phones from the USA. Turning to online marketplace
                platforms in Kenya proved unfruitful; fake phones, junk devices, inefficient communication, and downright fraud plagued the antiquated marketplaces.</p>
                <p>Inspired to find a solution, Tekesquared began as a project to build a better marketplace for selling quality technology devices to Kenyans at affordable
                prices. Quality, integrity, simplicity and low fees made Tekesquared different then and still do to this day. From the first Tekesquared sale (a Galaxy Note 5),
                Tekesquared aims to grow to be the ultimate used tech marketplace in Kenya. We enjoy creating a platform that makes it easy for people to directly buy great
                devices and everything we do revolves around this concept.</p>
